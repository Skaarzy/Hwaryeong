# Ssireum Tournament System

## Overview
The annual Ssireum tournament held at **White Tiger Mountain** (Baek Ho-san) is the Iron Palm Sect's primary means of survival and the realm's most anticipated martial gathering. Warriors, merchants, gamblers, and spectators from across the provinces converge on the sacred mountain for weeks of competition, feasting, and celebration. The tournament tests not just physical strength but endurance, technique, and the ability to read an opponent's balance and weight—core principles of traditional Korean wrestling refined through centuries of practice.
The MC can enter the tournament early in the game, climbing from obscurity through progressively competitive brackets until facing the legendary champions whose names are whispered throughout the martial world.

## Tournament Structure

### Entry and Registration
- **Location**: White Tiger Mountain, Iron Palm Sect compounds
- **Entry Fee**: Modest gold payment required to join (affordable but meaningful)
- **Timing**: Fixed point in the story when tournament is held; MC can participate when reaching this chapter
- **Bracket Assignment**: MC begins in the lowest bracket with least experienced fighters

### The Three Competition Tiers

#### Tier One: The Foundations
**Public Attendance**: Minimal - scattered spectators, mostly local apprentices and curious travelers **Prize Pool**: Small amounts of gold per victory **Opponent Quality**: Newer wrestlers, local champions from small villages, training disciples

**Progression**:
- MC fights multiple opponents in this tier
- Each victory earns modest monetary reward
- Spectator count remains low; little social consequence for loss
- Builds foundation understanding of tournament structure and Ssireum basics
**Advancement Trigger**: Defeat the Tier One **Mini-Boss** - typically the strongest local champion or an Iron Palm senior disciple who dominates this bracket. Victory here grants promotion to Tier Two.

#### Tier Two: The Proving Ground
**Public Attendance**: Moderate - growing crowd of dedicated spectators, local merchants taking bets, some sect members observing **Prize Pool**: Moderate amounts of gold per victory (noticeably increased) **Opponent Quality**: Regional champions, seasoned wrestlers, disciples from other martial schools

**Progression**:
- MC faces increasingly skilled opponents with distinct wrestling styles
- Each victory increases reputation among spectators and sect members
- Crowd reaction becomes noticeable - cheers, chants, recognition
- Gambling on MC's matches begins to escalate
**Advancement Trigger**: Defeat the Tier Two **Mini-Boss** - a formidable wrestler known throughout the region, possibly a wandering master or renowned champion. This victory marks the MC as a serious contender.

#### Tier Three: The Pinnacle
**Public Attendance**: Massive - the entire mountain fills with spectators, masters from various sects attend to observe, merchants run extensive betting operations, festival atmosphere dominates **Prize Pool**: Substantial gold rewards, potential for future sponsorships and opportunities **Opponent Quality**: Legendary warriors, masters of Ssireum, champions from previous years

**Progression**: Three consecutive fights without rest, each against progressively stronger opponents
- **First Match of Tier Three**:
    - Opponent: A well-known regional champion or sect master
    - Reward: Large monetary amount + significant reputation gain
    - Observation: Masters in crowd take note; MC begins being recognized as a rising threat
    - Social Impact: NPCs may begin referring to MC as a serious contender
- **Second Match of Tier Three**:
    - Opponent: A previous tournament champion or legendary warrior
    - Reward: Substantial gold + opportunity to claim the tournament title
    - Observation: The crowd becomes electric; multiple masters watch with genuine interest
    - Social Impact: Victory here makes MC a household name; the title is within reach
- **Third Match of Tier Three**:
    - Opponent: The reigning champion or the tournament's ultimate warrior
    - Reward: Championship title, massive gold prize, permanent fame
    - Observation: The entire mountain watches; this is the match people will remember for years
    - Social Impact: MC becomes known as tournament champion; referenced and deferred to in various situations

## Combat System: Historical Ssireum Rules

### The Foundation: The Satba Belt
Combat revolves around the **satba** - a thick cloth belt worn around the waist and thigh. Both wrestlers begin in a crouch, each gripping the opponent's satba, locked in close contact where leverage and balance dominate over raw strength.

### Core Mechanics

**Grip and Position**:
- Wrestlers maintain constant contact through the satba grip
- Movement is circular and controlled, each wrestler testing the other's balance
- Sudden shifts in weight and positioning create opportunities for throws

**Technique Categories**:
- **Hip Throws (Dwitgeoreum)** - The fundamental technique, using the satba grip to lever the opponent over the hips, sending them to the ground
- **Leg Sweeps (Balddakchigi)** - Attacking the opponent's stance by sweeping or tripping their legs, disrupting their center of gravity
- **Hooking Lifts (Deodeolchigi)** - Using leverage to lift the opponent completely off the ground, turning the match's direction through controlled strength

**Victory Condition**:
- Match ends when one wrestler's **upper body or knee touches the ground**
- Contact with the ground is immediate defeat - there is no recovery, no second chances
- Matches can end in seconds or extend for minutes as wrestlers circle, test grips, and seek openings

### Physical Demands
- **Endurance**: Wrestling multiple matches in succession requires stamina management
- **Reading Balance**: Understanding how an opponent distributes weight, where they're vulnerable
- **Timing**: Knowing the exact moment to execute a technique before the opponent anticipates
- **Adaptation**: Adjusting strategy based on opponent size, strength, and fighting style

### Environmental Factors
- **The Arena Floor**: Packed earth with rice straw mats - offers some grip but remains unpredictable
- **Crowd Noise**: Spectators' roaring can affect concentration; experienced wrestlers use crowd energy, novices may be distracted
- **Fatigue Accumulation**: Multiple fights without rest in Tier Three take their toll; endurance becomes as important as technique

## Reward Progression

### Monetary Rewards
- **Tier One victories**: Small amounts (building stake in tournament)
- **Tier One mini-boss**: Modest bonus
- **Tier Two victories**: Moderate amounts (noticeable income)
- **Tier Two mini-boss**: Significant bonus
- **Tier Three, First Match**: Large reward (substantial immediate payment)
- **Tier Three, Second Match**: Large reward + title opportunity
- **Tier Three, Third Match (Championship)**: Massive gold prize + permanent fame bonus

### Reputation and Social Recognition

**Tier One Progression**:
- Local awareness only
- Mentioned by Iron Palm disciples
- Small reputation gain with sect

**Tier Two Progression**:
- Regional recognition
- Sect masters take notice
- Increased respect from martial community
- Some NPCs begin to recognize the MC

**Tier Three Progression**:
- Widespread fame across provinces
- Masters from multiple sects know of the MC
- Tournament champion title becomes defining characteristic
- Significant reputation boost with Iron Palm Sect
- In certain story situations, MC may be referred to by title or offered opportunities based on championship status

### The Champion's Attire
Upon winning the championship (defeating all three opponents in Tier Three), the MC receives **the Champion's Ssireum Outfit** - the traditional wrestling attire worn by tournament victors. This outfit becomes a **permanent cosmetic item** in the MC's wardrobe, no longer limited to tournament use.

**Visual Significance**:
- Distinctive design marking the wearer as a tournament champion
- Can be worn during exploration, conversations, and cutscenes
- Serves as visible proof of achievement
- NPCs may react differently to the MC wearing champion attire

## Non-Active Tournament Elements

### Spectators and Lore
Some wrestlers at the tournament may be **memorable opponents already defeated** or **legendary figures too injured to compete**. These individuals serve as:
- **Atmospheric storytelling** - their presence enriches the tournament world
- **Lore sources** - conversations reveal tournament history and famous matches
- **Alternative interactions** - betting on specific matches, receiving advice, hearing war stories

### Past Champions
The Iron Palm Sect maintains records of previous tournament champions, whose names are carved into memorial stones or displayed in the sect hall. These historical records add depth to the tournament's prestige and significance.

## Design Philosophy
- **Earned Progression** - advancement through tournament requires genuine victory, not story mandates
- **Escalating Stakes** - each tier raises the stakes, rewards, and spectator involvement proportionally
- **Historical Authenticity** - Ssireum mechanics reflect actual traditional rules and techniques
- **Social Integration** - tournament success creates tangible reputation changes affecting how NPCs treat the MC
- **Optional But Rewarding** - players can ignore the tournament entirely or dedicate themselves to championship pursuit
- **Multiple Playstyles** - completionists can master every tournament aspect while casual players might do one or two matches for quick gold
- **Visible Achievement** - champion attire serves as permanent, visible proof of accomplishment
