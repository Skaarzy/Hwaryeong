## STORY DESCRIPTION

**Narrative Summary:**

Master Jeon-ho embodies the duality of conflict and harmony. Clad in armor that seamlessly blends martial robustness with serene elegance, his presence commands both respect and tranquility. He appears as a massive man—tall, somewhat chubby, in his 50s, with a large white topknot and a clean, impressive white beard. His visage is calm and composed, reflecting his role as a mediator between war and peace.

As the arbiter of justice, Jeon-ho oversees the balance between aggression and diplomacy. He guides warriors to fight with honor and leaders to seek peaceful resolutions. In times of turmoil, his counsel is sought to restore equilibrium, ensuring that neither chaos nor complacency prevails.

He uses a heavenly drum as his primary weapon, striking it with his palm. It's said the sound can break reality of realms and crack space and time itself. The scroll, though secondary, is more powerful than the drum—once he uses it, victory is assured. When he opens the scroll and speaks one of three words, reality bends to divine will: **WAR** kills with the strength of every war ever fought; **PEACE** protects or heals, can make enemies reconsider fighting; **JUDGMENT** judges the person—if evil, brings them to knees from pressure, makes immobile, stops breathing, arrests them in timeless loop like prison in their own body.

**Legacy:**

Master Jeon-ho stands as the eternal arbiter of war and peace throughout the Land of Hwaryeong. Worshipped by warriors seeking honor in combat and leaders seeking peaceful resolutions, his presence forces honest confrontation with the moral weight of violence. He represents the truth that justice is not simple, that both sides of conflict believe they're right, and that calling violence by comfortable names doesn't change its nature. His heavenly drum can break reality itself, while his sacred scroll holds absolute divine authority over war, peace, and judgment—three forces that shape all mortal existence. Those who meet him are forever changed by his refusal to offer comfort or easy answers, his insistence that one must face judgment head-on rather than avoid it, and his reminder that the real battle isn't winning the fight but living with what you became to win it. He is the heavy presence that watches conflicts unfold, the calm voice counting deaths without emotion, the divine judge who forces warriors to call their violence what it truly is and accept the judgment that comes after.
**Location:**
- A small hill overlooking a valley where a battle rages below.
- Bandits clash violently with local warriors—swords clashing, men screaming, blood being spilled.
- Master Jeon-ho stands alone at the hill's peak, hands clasped behind his back, watching silently.
- He's a massive man—tall, somewhat chubby, in his 50s, with a large white topknot and a clean, impressive white beard.
- His presence is like stone—unmoving, silent, heavy.
- The sounds of battle echo up the hill, but he remains perfectly still.

**Cutscene 1:**
1. Camera shows the MC climbing the hill, hearing the battle below.
2. As they reach the top, they see Jeon-ho's broad back, standing motionless.
3. The camera pans past him to show the brutal fighting in the valley—men dying, chaos, violence.
4. Jeon-ho doesn't acknowledge the MC's presence at all.
5. Wind moves his beard slightly; otherwise, complete stillness.
6. After a long silence, he speaks without moving, voice deep and flat:
    > "They've been fighting for three hours."

7. Another long pause as a scream echoes from below.
    > "Forty-two dead. More will follow."

8. He doesn't turn, doesn't move—just continues watching.
9. **Cutscene ends.**

**Voice Trigger:**
- If the player moves to stand beside him or tries to look at his face:
    > "Do you see justice down there? Or just men killing men?"

**Cutscene 2 (Stay and Watch):**
- If the MC stays and watches with him, Jeon-ho remains silent for a long moment.
- The battle continues below—someone falls, another charges.
- Finally, Jeon-ho speaks, voice quiet but carrying immense weight:
    > "The bandits raid because they're starving. The warriors defend because they're ordered. Both believe they're right."

- He slowly turns his head to look at the MC—his eyes are cold, ancient, tired.
    > "War never cares who's right. Only who's left standing."

- He turns back to the battle below.
    > "Most face moments like this. Where steel is the only answer left. Where words have already failed."

- He finally moves and stop right behind the mc. His presence feels unbearably heavy.
    > "When that moment comes, don't lie to yourself. Don't call it justice. Don't call it mercy."

- He start walking further.
    > "Call it what it is: your judgment of others. And know that same judgment is what comes after you...if u face it head on u will meet peace after, but if you try to avoid it u will find WAR."

- He begins walking down the opposite side of the hill, away from the battle, hands still clasped behind his back.
- Before disappearing over the ridge, he pauses without turning:
    > "Judgment is easy when you're not the one deciding. Living with it... that's the real battle."

- He vanishes over the hill.
- When the MC looks back at the valley, **the battle has suddenly stopped**—warriors emerged victorious, celebrating before slowly withdrawing.
- Where Jeon-ho stood, there's a **worn stone token** with a scale carved into it, heavy and cold to the touch.

**Reward:**
- **Judge's Token** (rare accessory) – Increases reputation gains and losses by 20% (choices matter more). Worn as a pendant. Simple but weighty.
