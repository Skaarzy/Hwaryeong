## STORY DESCRIPTION

**Narrative Summary:**

Ryeong-hee, The Serene Blossom, is a radiant spirit whose presence flows like a gentle breeze over still waters, embodying the seamless balance between love, beauty, and harmony. She is pale white-skinned and wears flowing white robes that ripple softly with her every movement. A slender sword rests lightly in her hand—the only thing left from her beloved, a cherished symbol of their enduring bond after his death.

Her aura exudes warmth and calm, inspiring those who encounter her to seek unity within themselves and with others. With eyes that reflect the soft hues of dawn and a smile that brings peace to troubled hearts, she moves gracefully, weaving invisible threads that bind souls and nurture lasting bonds. Neither possessive nor forceful, Ryeong-hee's influence encourages growth through understanding and gentle transformation, reminding mortals that true beauty blooms from harmony and heartfelt connection.

Considered a simple and unimportant deity by some, yet she is of major importance—for without her, hope would not exist. Her power is the control of making a person feel complete and have no regrets or necessity for resentment or anger. Her sword is more artifact than weapon, as it's said in stories that it was her loved one's sword which he gave to her after he died. Mostly worshipped by those who seek love and hope for most things, she is the only deity that the others cannot and do not want to harm, recognizing that hope itself must be protected.

**Legacy:**

Ryeong-hee stands as the divine embodiment of hope's persistence throughout the Land of Hwaryeong. Though considered simple or unimportant by some, she is recognized by the wise as one of the most crucial deities—for without hope, even the strongest warriors lose their will to continue. She represents the profound truth that love transcends death, that those who are gone are never truly forgotten as long as someone waits and remembers.

Her power to make people feel complete, to remove the necessity for resentment and anger, offers a form of healing that no medicine or martial technique can provide. She teaches that the harmony of love and hope isn't about possession or presence, but about willingness to let loved ones cross into death feeling that love, while those left behind accept the pain of their absence. Her sword—the only remnant of her own lost beloved—serves as eternal reminder that even deities know loss, yet continue spreading hope despite personal grief.

Worshipped by those seeking love and hope, her gentle presence at broken bridges and sites of tragedy brings comfort to the grieving and strength to the despairing. She is the only deity that others cannot and will not harm, for all recognize that hope itself must be protected if any meaning is to survive in a world filled with suffering. She weaves invisible threads between souls, creating bonds that death cannot sever and memories that time cannot erase. In her serene presence, people understand that being forgotten is the only true death—that as long as love and hope persist in those who remain, the departed live on in ways that transcend mere physical existence.
## **Ryeong-hee Encounter – Broken Bridge at Dawn**

**Location:**

- A half-collapsed wooden bridge over a gorge at sunrise.
- Morning mist rises from below; the bridge sways slightly in the wind.
- Ryeong-hee stands at the broken edge, facing the gap, completely still.

**Cutscene 1:**
1. Camera shows the MC approaching the bridge from behind.
2. Ryeong-hee is humming a soft, sad melody—barely audible over the wind.
3. She **doesn't turn** but stops humming as the MC gets closer.
4. Long silence. Then she speaks without turning:
    > "It broke three days ago. Seven people fell. Their families still come here... waiting."

5. She gestures vaguely toward the far side—there are **small offerings**: flowers, food, letters tied to posts.
    > "They leave these. As if love could bring them back."

6. **Cutscene ends.**
**Voice Trigger:**
- If the player tries to leave:
    > "Strange, isn't it? They are gone, but those still here keep waiting for them to return. Their hope is stronger than most others."

**Cutscene 2 (Approach):**
- If the MC walks closer, Ryeong-hee finally turns, smiling gently but with sad eyes.
- > "Do you think hope is foolish? Or is it the only thing that matters?"
- She looks back at the offerings across the gap.
    > "Seven are gone forever. But look—" she gestures at the far side, "—They won't be forgotten ever. Isn't that more important than hope?"

- She look at her sword mournfully but then looks at the sky and smiles again
    > "Harmony of love and hope isn't about with who u share your love. It's about if u are willing to let them cross feeling the love while you, after they are gone, feel the pain."

- She jumps across the broken bridge effortlessly, disappears into the mist on the other side.
- When the MC looks down, there's **a single rare flower** lying where she stood—petals still fresh with morning dew.
- The offerings remain on the far side, untouched.

**Reward:**
- **Serene Blossom** (rare crafting material) – Can be used to create powerful healing tonics or medicines. Extremely rare in the wild.
