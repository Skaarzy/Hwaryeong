## STORY DESCRIPTION

**Narrative Summary:**

Wol-hee and Seong-hee are twin goddesses who drift silently through the flow of time. Shrouded in twilight-colored robes, their appearance is ghostlike and distant—one veiled in soft moonlight, the other lit with drifting starlight. Though they are sisters and divine complements, their personalities reflect the very domains they govern.

**Wol-hee** governs Memory and the Past, keeper of forgotten names and ancient sorrows. Her breath stirs old ruins and echoes through ancestral prayers. She is usually sleepy and bored, reminiscing constantly on the past and bringing up random events in conversations that happened long ago. She appears as a bulky, masculine-featured woman with strong shoulders and capable hands, working behind the counter of a ground-floor tavern with an easy, relaxed demeanor. She chats casually with regulars, laughing at their stories, wiping cups and serving food efficiently. Most would never guess the tired tavern keeper who complains about remembering too many faces is actually a goddess who knows every forgotten moment in history.

**Seong-hee** guides Dreams and What Is Yet to Be, whispering to prophets, artists, and fools alike. Her steps leave no mark but shape what follows. She is more of a busy body with a bubbly personality, always ready to do something and planning things way in the future, always talking about imaginary places and telling grand usually exaggerated stories. She appears slimmer and more delicate than her sister, with distant dreamlike eyes that see through rather than at people. She works as a fortune-teller in a quiet room on the second floor of the same building, surrounded by yarrow stalks, coins, and divination tools. She traces patterns in the air, speaks of possibilities and paths not yet chosen, warning of meetings with those already lost and losses yet to come.

Together, they govern Time not as rulers but as witnesses—watching all rise, all fade, and all return. They complement each other perfectly: one preserves what was while the other guides what will be, creating complete understanding of time's eternal flow.

**Legacy:**

The Twin Goddesses Wol-hee and Seong-hee stand as the divine embodiment of time's dual nature throughout the Land of Hwaryeong. Worshipped by those seeking to understand the past and navigate the future, they represent the truth that time flows in both directions simultaneously—what was shapes what will be, while what will be gives meaning to what was.

Wol-hee teaches that memories are not just records but living forces—that the ones we want to keep slip away while the ones we want gone stick like tree sap, that what we carry from the past remains with us whether remembered clearly or not. Her gifts unlock connections to forgotten moments, revealing how the past still shapes the present.

Seong-hee demonstrates that the future is not fixed but fluid—that dreams are possibilities waiting to be born, that paths shift with every choice, and that what is yet to come is already dreaming itself awake. Her prophecies warn and guide without controlling, respecting that everyone must make their own choices even if they forget her warnings.

Together, they prove that understanding time requires embracing both memory and possibility, acknowledging what was while remaining open to what will be. They are the twin witnesses who drift through time's eternal flow, neither ruling nor interfering, simply watching all rise, all fade, and all return in cycles beyond mortal comprehension. Their presence in the same building—one serving drinks on the ground floor while reminiscing about the past, the other reading fortunes on the second floor while imagining the future—creates a perfect temporal crossroads where those seeking wisdom about time can find guidance from both directions at once.

## **Wol-hwa Encounter – Ground Floor Tavern**

**Location:**
- Ground floor of a modest two-story building in a quiet town.
- Simple tavern with a few patrons eating and drinking quietly.
- Wol-hwa, a bulky, masculine-featured woman with strong shoulders and capable hands, works behind the counter—wiping cups, serving food efficiently.
- She has an easy, relaxed demeanor, chatting casually with regulars.

**Cutscene 1:**
1. Camera shows the MC entering the tavern in the evening.
2. Wol-hwa is laughing at something a customer said, slapping the counter good-naturedly.
3. She spots the MC and waves them over casually:
    > "Hey! New face. Come on, sit. You look like you need a drink."

4. As the MC sits, she pours them something without asking, sets it down.
5. She leans on the counter, studying the MC's face with casual interest:
    > "Huh. You remind me of someone. Can't quite place it though."

6. She shrugs, grinning slightly:
    > "Happens a lot in my line of work. See so many faces, they all start blending together."
    
7. **Cutscene ends.**

**Voice Trigger:**
- If the player examines old decorations or asks about the tavern:
    > "This place? Been here longer than anyone remembers. Even me, probably." (laughs)

**Cutscene 2 (Stay and Talk):**
- If the MC stays and drinks, Wol-hwa comes back after serving others.
- She refills their cup, leaning against the counter comfortably:
    > "You got that look, you know. Like you're trying to forget something. Or maybe remember it."

- She wipes down the counter idly:
    > "Funny thing about memories. The ones you want to keep? Those slip away. The ones you want gone? Those stick like tree sap."

- She stops cleaning and looks at the MC directly now, more serious:
    > "Whatever you're carrying from back then—it's still with you. Whether you remember it clearly or not."

- She straightens up, back to her casual demeanor:
    > "Anyway. My sister upstairs does the fortune-telling thing. I just pour drinks and like to listen to interesting stories." (laughs) "Easier job, if you ask me."

- A customer calls for her; she pats the counter:
    > "Stick around if you want. Or don't. Either way... I’ll keep you in mind."

- She walks off to serve others.
- When the MC looks at their table, there's a **small old key** left on a worn piece of paper with their name written on it—in handwriting they don't recognize but feels familiar.
**Reward:**
- **Forgotten Key** (rare accessory/quest item) – Opens a locked chest somewhere in the world that contains an item tied to the MC's past. The key feels old, like it's been waiting a long time.


## **Seong-un Encounter – Second Floor Fortune-Telling Room**
**Location:**
- Second floor of the same building, accessed by wooden stairs.
- A quiet, intimate room filled with the scent of incense.
- Seong-un sits at a low table, yarrow stalks, coins, and divination tools arranged precisely.
- She's slimmer, more delicate than her sister, with distant, dreamlike eyes.
- Candles flicker, casting long shadows.

**Cutscene 1:**
- If the MC climbs the stairs, they enter a dimly lit room.
- Seong-un sits at a low table, yarrow stalks and coins arranged before her.
- She doesn't look up immediately, her fingers tracing patterns in the air above the divination tools.
> "Sit. You've been standing at a crossroads for longer than you realize."

4. The MC enters; Seong-un doesn't look up, focused on the coins before her.
5. > "Sit."
6. The MC sits across from her.

- She finally looks up—her eyes are distant, dreamlike, seeing through rather than at the MC:
> "I don't tell futures. I whisper them. To dreamers, to madmen, to those desperate enough to listen."

- She picks up the yarrow stalks, letting them fall naturally:
    > "Dreams aren't lies. They're possibilities waiting to be born. What you dream tonight might become real a tomorrow."

- She studies the fallen stalks, then the MC's face, then their hands:
    > "Your path ahead is not set. It shifts with every choice. But some things... some things are already moving toward you."

- She looks at their palm closely:
    > "You'll meet someone you've already lost. Or lose someone you have met. Time doesn't care which comes first."
8. **Cutscene ends.**

**Cutscene 2 (Stay for Reading):**
- Seong-un gestures to the MC's hands:
    > "Give me your palm."

- If the MC complies, she traces the lines slowly, not quite touching the skin:
    > "You walk two paths. One you chose. One that chose you."


- She lets go of the Mc and stands slowly, moving toward the window:
    > "What is yet to come is already dreaming itself awake. You are part of that dream."

- She looks out at the darkening sky:
    > "My sister remembers what was. I see what wants to be. Together, we witness. We do not command or control."

- She turns back, her form seeming to blur slightly in the candlelight:
    > "You will forget most of this when the choice come by either ignoring my words or going your own way. But that's how its meant to be, neither i or nobody else has the control of your dreams and choices u make in them."

- The candles flicker strongly—**Seong-un** sits back down.
- The room feels suddenly empty, as if untouched for years.
- On the table, there's a **small dreamcatcher made of strange thread** and a **coin with two faces**—one showing a moon, one showing a star.

**Reward:**
- **Dreamweaver's Token** (rare accessory) – Occasionally grants brief premonitions of danger (dodge chance +5%).
- **Two-Faced Coin** (rare consumable) – can be used to buy a item for free.
