The Third Demon Commander, Heuk-wol is a creature of silence and fear a phantom cloaked in darkness, moving in the shadows like a whisper of death. While others roar, blaze, or command armies, Heuk-wol says nothing and does nothing unless commanded by Tak-jin , even if it means to stay in one place for days without moving he does it with ease. His presence is like a cold draft in the dead of night unnatural, unnoticed… until it is too late. He never speaks unless directly addressed by Tak-gu, and even then, his replies are brief, emotionless, and quiet. He does not need to assert his power his mere existence is a constant reminder that death can come without warning, without form, and without mercy. His body can become a shadow by infusing his qi into it making him be able to merge with any shadow in his area and he can move across rivers in a single step, its like a flowing mist that seems to drink in light itself. Warriors tell stories that even in sunlight, his silhouette is pitch dark smoke, and in battle, he often vanishes entirely. What he leaves behind are corpses cleanly slain, without sound or struggle. His movements are untraceable, and he walks without footprints or scent sometimes even becoming a show of his target and following them for days until the right moment, making him nearly impossible to track.Only Tak-gu has saw his face. Despite appearing as a mere servant or shadow at the side of other commanders, Heuk-wol is arguably the most dangerous of them all because nobody knows his real limit, also he is the only one who is allowed to regularly stands near Tak-gu and observe his master. Many believe he serves as the Heavenly Demon’s personal executioner, a blade hidden behind the throne. He wields a simple blade in hand but his main weapon is his shadow itself as he can physical control, transforming and becoming his weapon, stretching, slicing, piercing, and bending to his will of course this was his ability he gained after drinking Tak-jin"s blood. He can melt into the ground, rise behind opponents,. It is said his Qi is not alive, but a smoke that is darker than the night, impossible to sense until it is too late. Even among demon commander, no one trusts Heuk-wol not because he is disloyal, but because he is too quiet, too still, never sleeps and is faceless.His origin is not know to anybody among the 8 generals and only Tak-jin knows some of his history but that is also not a full story.He wears a iron mask fitted perfectly to his face , and big loose dark robes with a lot of accessories under the first coat.
