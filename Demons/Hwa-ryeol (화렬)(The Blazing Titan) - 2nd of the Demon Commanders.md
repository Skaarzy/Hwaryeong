Second of the Six Demon Commanders, Hwa-ryeol is a mountain of muscle and fury, a being whose very presence scorches the earth beneath his feet. Towering above others, his body is wrapped in pale blue almost purple skin looking like a cold corpse, and when he uses his qi it turns dark red crimson color from all the heat and it starts glowing faintly. Not merely skin-deep, his flesh is fused with infernal essence, making him immune to fire and capable of absorbing heat and flames to fuel his power.He gained this unique kind of Qi because he drank Tak-jin"s blood and as he says it , it burned harder then the scorching sun itself, and it devoured him transforming his body and skin to what its become. Unlike Reung-ji , who wins wars with his mind, Hwa-ryeol crushes his enemies with overwhelming force. He is the Demon commanders walking catastrophe, a being of pure destruction and rage, forged for war and conquest. When the Heavenly Demon desires devastation without subtlety, it is Hwa-ryeol who is unleashed. Similar to Reung-ji Hwa-ryeol did not use a weapon but not for the same reasons , as no matter what weapon he picks up as soon as his uses his Qi it melts under the immense heat so his preferable fighting style is mostly with his hands. Which are said to shatter mountains with a single punch and that they are capable  setting forests ablaze with a single swing. Despite his size and power, Hwa-ryeol is no mindless beast. He is loyal not because he was forced, but because he worships Tak-gu. He calls the Heavenly Demon “the Flame That Cannot Die,” and sees himself as the fuel of that flame, a tool meant to destroy the old world so the new one may rise.He was the person who was commanded to make the first move and start the war by killing the Falling petal immortal who was a grand elder of the Plum Blossom sect , and not only did he kill the elder but also destroyed the whole side of the mountain where they fought leaving only ash.Mostly acts calm and collected speaking with a deep voice yet clearly, but after he unleashes his Qi he turns into a beast that is smiling and just loving the fighting not once did he fear a battle not even if it meant death.He dies in a battle while in the war against Plum Blossom sword saint who was searching for his masters killer.After a long and destructive battle it ended with Hwa-ryeol"s flame finally going out after the Plum Blossom Sword Saint stabbed him in the heart.
Transformation:
His red, starts breaking of like cracked skin constantly leaks embers and sparks, and when gets enraged, his entire body becomes engulfed in living flame. Warriors who try to strike him find their weapons melt, and their techniques burn away before reaching him. The heat around him alone can turn unprotected flesh to ash. Unlike the cunning or subtle Demon Commanders, Hwa-ryeol believes in one thing:
Power is truth. If you burn it to the ground, no one can lie about it anymore.
1. **Skin transition:** As he channels his fire technique, his purple-ish skin **heats and reddens**, glowing faintly from the heat beneath.
2. **Cracking effect:** The outer layer of skin **starts to char like burnt wood**, forming small cracks and flaking off slowly. Between the cracks, tiny **embers glow**, showing the raw heat and power under his skin.
3. **Falling flakes:** As the technique reaches full intensity, these charred flakes **fall away**, revealing his true **dark red, infernal skin** beneath—muscle and power fully exposed.
4. **Aftermath:** The visual effect is like a **living, walking forge**: the heat and fire literally “burn away” the outer layer of his mortal-like skin, emphasizing both his destructive power and demonic nature.
