Hyeon-jun, also known as The Black Blood, is the 6th of the Demon Commanders, and despite being the weakest in terms of raw power, he is arguably the most dangerous. His greatest strength lies not in physical combat, but in his unnatural ability to change his identity at will. Hyeon-jun possesses a rare and unique physique that allows him to transform his body, including his appearance, blood, and even his DNA, into anyone he desires , the reason for this was because of him drinking the blood of Tak-jin. This power of shape-shifting and infiltration makes him a master of deception, capable of blending in seamlessly with any crowd, infiltrating the highest circles, and assuming any persona necessary to carry out his mission. Hyeon-jun’s abilities go even further. When he kills the person he impersonates and drinks their blood, he gains access to some of the important of their memories a process that allows him to inherit the knowledge, skills, and experiences of his victims of course this only works if the person is freshly dead and not if they start decomposing. This gives him a unique advantage, as he can quickly adapt and act with the wisdom of those he’s slain, making him not just a master of disguise, but also a vessel for endless knowledge. Though he is physically weak compared to his fellow Demon Commanders, his influence is immeasurable. Hyeon-jun has already infiltrated the highest echelons of power, even the Emperor’s inner circle, using his shape-shifting abilities to manipulate those around him without ever being detected. He pulls strings from the shadows, leaving no trace of his involvement while subtly guiding others towards his goals. Hyeon-jun is always several steps ahead of his enemies, using his ability to manipulate people and situations to his advantage. His ultimate ambition is not to dominate through force, but to cause slow decay from within, turning even the most trusted individuals into pawns in his grand scheme.
While many underestimate him due to his lack of visible strength, Hyeon-jun is the unseen hand that guides the downfall of many.He is another demon general not living inside the prison but out in the world , his location is at the imperial court and in the Divine Seal sect main pavilion as he is transformed as the master of Divine Seal sect and is acting out his duties , he is there mostly for stopping the killing of other demons and hiding their presence bidding their time.His personality changes based on who he is playing as but if he is not impersonating anybody and in his original form he is extroverted often joking around even around other generals who hate it .
