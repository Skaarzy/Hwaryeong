**"Victory lies not in the strength of the strike, but in the mind that commands it."**
Reung-ji, First of the Six Demon Commanders, is the strategist Tak-jin trusts above all others. His mind is sharper than any blade and more dangerous than any army. He rarely needs to fight; his intellect alone decides the fate of nations. When the Heavenly Demon requires strategy, it is Reung-ji who shapes the world’s movements.
Before serving Tak-jin, Reung-ji was a warlord from a fallen Ming-era clan. He traveled to the continent as part of the Jeong Dynasty envoys, but his role was little more than that of a servant. Feeling overlooked and used, resentment grew until he abandoned the Ming entirely. By chance—or destiny—Tak-jin found him. Reung-ji was already known for dismantling enemies through precision and calculation rather than brute force, turning armies into collapsing structures with a few well-placed decisions.
He aligned himself with Tak-jin out of fascination with the Heavenly Demon’s unstoppable power and after weighing every risk and reward. Tak-jin represented the one variable beyond prediction, the force that could reshape the world. Reung-ji became the architect of every plan: when to strike, where to move, how to adapt as the war shifts. While others march, he directs the entire conflict from the shadows.
Reung-ji carries a beautifully crafted **Deungchae**, a baton-mace symbol of command that never sees use in battle. It exists purely to mark his authority and his calculated approach to war. His true weapon is his mind.
Beyond strategy, Reung-ji possesses psychic talents. His **Mind’s Embrace** allows him to slip suggestions into a person with a few words or read intent from the slightest movements. He can overwhelm a will, turn hesitation into self-destruction, and bend outcomes to match his plan. He doesn’t just predict the battlefield—he shapes it.
His armies follow him not out of fear, but because he is never wrong. Every victory is born from his foresight. Reung-ji has never failed Tak-jin, and he remains the only commander who refused to use the Heavenly Demon’s blood, insisting that his mind alone is enough to destroy the Jeong Dynasty.
While the other commanders lead charges and break lines, Reung-ji defines the path they walk. He orchestrates the fall of the Jeong Dynasty from behind the scenes, calculating millions of variables in moments. His Deungchae is more than a baton—it is the emblem of a man who believes he commands fate itself.
