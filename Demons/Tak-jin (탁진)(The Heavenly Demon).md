Born as a half-deity son of Master Un-mok (Deity of Merriment, Wandering Spirits, and Freedom) and a human woman, form the day he was born he was experimented on by the emperor and certain people form the Jeong Dynasty, who tortured and studied him to understand and weaponize his blood thinking it would give them a advantage on the sects and the clans, which twisted his worldview into seeing the most evil done by the most powerful and thinking the world is fundamentally evil and needs to be changed through force. After escaping the emperor and the Jeong Dynasty, he gathered eight fellow outcasts who became his generals after drinking his blood and gaining enhanced abilities, and he now leads a cult that uses human experimentation and "demonic" imagery to recruit desperate people, viewing his actions as justice against a world that is the bigger monster than him, through its cruelty and neglect. Ruler of all of the demons. Feared by all sects—orthodox, unorthodox, or demonic—Tak-jin is the undisputed ruler of the Demon Path. His name alone is forbidden in some temples, whispered in others as both warning and prophecy. He is not a sage, not a fallen immortal, but something wholly other. Born of blood and will, Tak-jin is a demon whose very existence defies cultivation norms. His Qi of the unique white color is not gathered through meridian flow but created directly by his heart, a unique core that pulses with black fire. His body does not circulate Qi it generates it, raw and furious. He possesses the most powerful telekinesis in existence even that of the emperors is weaker, capable of shattering cities with his force or controlling thousands of blades like extensions of his fingers. His blood is corruptive and poisonous, able to infect others from the inside out. When he drinks the blood of enemies, it does not just restore him it turns their life into his, converting their energy into his Qi and prolonging his unending vitality. His most feared technique is the creation of the Supreme Asura Demons which are his actual solidified Qi, these beasts shaped are by his will alone. They are massive, violent, and utterly loyal, controlled like puppets from within his mind. The more he creates, and the stronger they are, the more his Qi is drained. But his enemies rarely last long enough for this to matter. He has no sect, no throne, and no army. But those abandoned by their sects, those discarded by Jeong Dynastys, and those who have tasted betrayal all kneel before his shadow. Entire cults worship him as a living god, though he rarely cares. His doctrine is simple: "Power must not beg for permission." He accepts no disciples, but if someone were to gain his interest, it would not be through loyalty or lineage but by surviving his presence and daring to look into his eyes without fear. It is said his sword a black blade with no name once belonged to the first demon he killed. Others say it belonged to the deity who tried to kill him. He has never confirmed either. He has 8 so called commanders that offered themselves for him to do with them and command them as he wants.



A Darkness so deep no light dares tread,  
Yet a brilliance blinding mortal sight.  
Heart-wrenched anger, turned to ice,  
A volcano poised to ignite clear skies.

He laughs at simplicity of men,  
Yet trembles before what might it bring.  
Walked through hell, grasping for the sky  
And suddenly stood on a cloud
Longing for the fire below.

Amusement and dread entwined,  
Resentment sharp as diamond.  
A being of paradox, of pain and power,  
A storm contained, ready to unleash.




**A Darkness so deep no light dares tread,  
Yet a brilliance blinding mortal sight.**
- This opening establishes the paradoxical nature of the figure: immense darkness paired with overwhelming, almost divine brilliance. It conveys someone **beyond normal human comprehension**, both terrifying and awe-inspiring.

**Heart-wrenched anger, turned to ice,  
A volcano poised to ignite the skies.**
- Shows **controlled but immense power**. The anger is deep, emotionally rooted, but cold and measured. The volcano imagery suggests latent **destructive potential**, ready to erupt if provoked.

**He laughs at simplicity of men,  
Yet trembles before what it might bring.**
- Highlights **duality**: he is superior, mocking human weakness, yet aware of potential threats. This reflects **calculated caution** and a mind that constantly measures risk and consequence.

**Walked through hell, grasping for the sky,  
And suddenly stood on a cloud,  
Longing for the fire below.**
- Symbolizes **experience of extremes**. He has endured suffering (“hell”) yet ascended beyond it (“stood on a cloud”), maintaining a **connection to pain and destruction** (“longing for the fire below”). He exists between worlds — mortal and godlike, human and demon.

**Amusement and dread entwined,  
Resentment sharp as diamond.**
- Shows his **emotional complexity**: he finds amusement even in chaos and fear, while his anger has hardened into something **cold and unbreakable**, like diamond.

**A being of paradox, of pain and power,  
A storm contained, ready to unleash.**
- Summarizes the essence: he is **contradictory, dangerous, and immensely powerful**, maintaining control like a storm held in check, but capable of **unleashing catastrophic force** at any moment.


## The Battle - A Scheduled Task
Tak-jin steps onto the battlefield with the same detached efficiency as completing any routine chore. Pung In-sul, the legendary "Whispering Storm," represents nothing more than a necessary removal - an obstacle that must be eliminated at precisely this moment for his plan to continue as planned .The fight itself holds no drama from his perspective. While observers see an epic clash between legend and demon, Tak-jin experiences it as simple maintenance work. Pung In-sul's rope dart dances, his flying daggers strike like lightning, but to Tak-jin these are merely the death throes of something already concluded. The outcome was never in question - only the timing mattered.When the Whispering Storm falls, Tak-jin observes his generals mocking the humans, claiming this wasn't even half his power. He neither confirms nor denies this - the statement is irrelevant. The task is complete. He returns to his sanctuary with the same measured pace he arrived with, leaving behind a shattered human resistance exactly as intended.

## The War's End - Perfect Calculation
Years pass. The humans achieve their "victory" - the emperor sacrifices himself, the jade army destroys the demonic forces, the survivors celebrate. From Tak-jin's mountain sanctuary, he observes these events with complete indifference but knows he achieved what he wanted which was all that mattered to him. The emperor who tortured him as a child is dead. The Jeong Dynasty that enabled his suffering lies in ruins - hollow crown, broken economy, fractured society. The humans believe they won through strength and sacrifice, never understanding they were merely completing the final steps of his revenge. His demons retreat not in defeat, but because their leader said so. The war was never about conquest or domination - it was about ensuring those who wronged him paid the ultimate price. Mission accomplished.

## The Deal - Meaningless Words
When the sect leaders approach with their "binding agreement" - live but cause no harm, and cease drinking blood - Tak-jin accepts with the same indifference he might show to changing weather. They cannot kill him, this much is understood by all parties. They offer him continued existence in exchange for peace and the abandonment of his blood consumption that had sustained and empowered him. His response is neither agreement nor defiance, but simple acknowledgment. The terms of their deal are as irrelevant as the chirping of birds outside his cave. He achieved what he came for. Whether they call him prisoner, threat, or forgotten relic matters nothing. The world beyond his mountain has become background noise. The sect leaders believe they have cleverly contained the greatest threat to their new order. In reality, they are negotiating with someone who has transcended caring about the very concepts they use to bind him. He doesn't resist because resistance would require investment in outcomes that no longer register as significant.

## The Aftermath - Hollow Completion
Tak-jin remains in his sanctuary, not bound by their words but by the completion of his singular purpose. He is not bored, not angry, not satisfied in any conventional sense. He simply exists in a state where external events - wars, politics, the rise and fall of new powers - occur at a distance that renders them meaningless.Now focusing on the city under the mountain and those demons and generals that survived managing them to not break the agreement or make things annoying for him, making this now his own kind of Jeong Dynasty he neither wants or need but is simply controlling it because they all look to him for answers. The most dangerous being in the world sits quietly, contained not by force or magic, but by his own absolute lack of interest in anything beyond what he has already accomplished. The revenge is complete. Everything else is just noise.

**Cutscene 1:**  
The MC enters Tak-jin’s chamber. He sits slumped in his throne, breathing heavily, each inhale and exhale labored, his posture conveying extreme strain. His appearance mirrors Pic 5. He speaks slowly, pausing every few words to catch his breath. When the MC asks about learning his power, Tak struggles to rise, taking each step as if his body might fail. Chains hang from his arms and legs, dragging with every movement. He stops, staring at the MC, and asks in his slow, deliberate voice, “Why does everybody want my power? What makes you think you deserve it?”

At the MC’s response, Tak’s power erupts. With a deafening roar, the chains shatter, snapping and falling with bone-rattling force, revealing the sheer magnitude of his strength.

---

**Cutscene 2:**  
Suddenly, Tak teleports with lightning speed to a position just behind the MC but slightly to the side. Before the MC can react, he seizes the sword from the ground with multiple arms and simultaneously grabs the MC by their arms and legs, forcing them to their knees. It mirrors the chains he once wore, but is now fully his ability in action. His voice remains weak and labored as he growls, “None of you understand anything, and all you can think about is greed and power.”
He teleports back to his throne, rising in a web of countless arms—each supporting the other, thousands in total—lifting him as he speaks. “Tell all of your kind,” he continues, his voice shifting into a clearer, more demonic timbre as he shouts, “The next human that enters here asking for my powers—SHALL DIE!”
The camera pans out, framing Tak as a king enthroned in absolute authority. With a final, furious shout, “NOW GET OUT,” he waves his hand. In an instant, the MC is flung from the room with such speed that the camera cannot follow, waking up somewhere else far from his chamber.

---

**Subsequent Visits:**  
Whenever the MC returns, Tak is usually asleep. Even in rest, his breathing is a battle; it’s harsh, ragged, and almost as if he struggles for life, though his face remains neutral, showing no pain. Upon noticing the MC, he simply lifts a hand and says calmly, “Die.” One of his spectral arms emerges from the ground, seizing the MC by the neck and snapping it. No matter how many times the MC enters, death is instantaneous and unyielding—Tak’s control over life and death in his domain is absolute.
