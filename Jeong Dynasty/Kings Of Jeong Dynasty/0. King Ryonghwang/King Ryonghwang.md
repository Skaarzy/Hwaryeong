The third kind after the kingdom of Jeong separated from the Ming empire .He has long dark really beard same thing with his hair it was very long and dark known for his height and being really tall, He was a ruthless , cunning and stern ruler so he got the nickname Shocking Dragon, he had 2 children which was not uncommon but rare , he was never a person that wanted love or compassion so he had only one wife and he never wanted children and only hoped for one which would be a boy and carry the Jeong Dynasty , but his first child was a girl and so he tried for a second and luckily a boy was born .After the birth of his son, Jeong Ryong **ordered his Queen Consort (Wangbi) to leave Gyotaejeon and reside in another palace**, but she **retained her status as the queen**. This was **not a demotion or punishment**, just a relocation by the king’s command as she was not needed anymore as he never cared about love or compassion .Her title remained the same; the only change was her place of residence. Jeong Ryong was also obsessed with shamanism and the occult part of the world , after he heard a rumor about a child of deity blood he ordered the royal guards to capture him which leads to Jeong Ryong imprisoning Tak-Jeong and torturing him and experimenting on him, all because Jeong Ryong wanted power and strength to expand the kingdom and grow it further , later the child escaped.  The kingdom at this time was still growing so Jeong Ryong focused on keeping it that way and not slowing down the growth of the kingdom, which is why his nature was harsh and stern, he didn't want to become the king who was the one to stop the great era of the Jeong Dynasty making him spend most his life in the offices and court of the kingdom. As he got older he got more and more frustrated that things weren't going as planned as the whole kingdom experienced a mild recession as the Li trading company was established which was a competitor of the kingdom but in the end it was solved by Jeong Ryong who made a early deal with the Li Trading Company to make them partners of a kind and not interfere in each other trades , which then continued the great era of Jeong Dynasty but suddenly he suffered a heart attack which killed him. His son Jeong Woo-jin became his successor.
