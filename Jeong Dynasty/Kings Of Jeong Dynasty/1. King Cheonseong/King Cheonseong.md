[[Scars of Triumph]]

**King Cheonseong (천성 / 天聖) – “Heavenly Saint”**

The King Cheonseong was a younger ruler who gained the throne after his father [[King Ryonghwang]] died of a sudden heart attack,he became emperor when he was 27 (1348 year)
Made the army of 5000 jade soldiers named [[Heavenly Imperial Guard]] which he controlled with his mind it was a secret technique that was created by the Divine Seal sect specifically for him, he had 4 children 3 daughters and 1 sons , the ages where : 
- **1st daughter (1350):** Jeong Woo-jin was **26 years old**
- **2nd daughter (1352):** Jeong Woo-jin was **28 years old**
- **3rd daughter (1354):** Jeong Woo-jin was **30 years old**
- **Son (1357):** Jeong Woo-jin was **33 years old**
Like his father he didn't care about love or companionship but only about producing a heir who would continue his legacy, he didn't care much about his daughters but still would grant them anything they wanted, as he considered they deserve anything they want because of their lineage and him being their father, his son on the other hand he held on a pedestal teaching him from young age of 7 and always being stern towards him and punishing him if the son would fail or make a mistake. Jeong Woo-jin was often called reckless and too chaotic of a king, as he believed that his father Jeong Ryong didn't die by natural causes but that someone killed him, which is why he create the soldiers and never trusted most of the royal court officials, yet with all that the kingdom still was flourishing for a long time as he still made decision that benefited the people of the kingdom even built the second mayor city in the province then the Eternal war started.Jeong Woo-jin died defending the capital city of the kingdom against demons in a last struggle battle which helped win the war against the demons.

His death :
While defending the walls of the kingdom with his Heavenly Imperial Guard and is somewhat succeeding without much effort or being strained until [[Yang Cheong (양청) Grand Exorcist]] who was at his side aiding him by healing him suddenly just stabs King Cheonseong in the back directly where the heart is and reveals his true identity of being a shapeshifter demon and one of the 8 demonic generals, but unknown to Yang Cheong that cause the whole army of 5000 becoming unstable and imploding themselves which kills most of the demons and Yang Cheong along with the already dying king who both get blown up by the couple of Heavenly Imperial Guards who where standing near them and guarding them this whole debacle ends  the demon war with the Heavenly Demon watching from the roof of the royal house all the explosions happen and doesn't even wait for the smoke to settle as he turns away and leaps in the sky.
