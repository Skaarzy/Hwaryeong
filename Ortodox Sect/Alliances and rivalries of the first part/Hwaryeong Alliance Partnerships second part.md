Unlike the Pre-Eternal War era, there are **NO formal partnerships between alliances** in the post-war period. The creation of the **Martial Council** eliminated the need for alliance-to-alliance diplomacy. All alliances now meet in the Martial Council to discuss sect matters, provide mutual aid, and resolve disputes. The Council serves as the central diplomatic forum, replacing the complex web of inter-alliance partnerships that existed before the war. Alliances still exist for internal support, security, and shared ideological goals, but external cooperation happens through the Martial Council, not bilateral alliance agreements.
