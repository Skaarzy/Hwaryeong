**Geographic Position:** Eastern provinces
**Members:**
- Plum Blossom Sect

## ## **Alliance 2: The Iron Storm Pact (철풍 맹약 - Cheolpung Maengyak)**

**Members:**
- Heavenly Sword Sect
- Divine Thunder Hall
**Type:** Noble Warrior Alliance
**Philosophy:** True strength comes from martial excellence, disciplined power, and **the warrior's code of honor**.

- Heavenly Sword: Precision, elite swordsmanship, restraint, strategic wisdom, philosophical depth
- Divine Thunder: Overwhelming force, coordinated assault, explosive power, military discipline, unity

- No assassination, no poison, no deception in combat
- Respecting rituals and martial traditions
- Direct confrontation over underhanded tactics
- Earning victory through strength and skill, not trickery

Divine Thunder is extremely isolationist and distrustful of everyone - Heavenly Sword is their sole external connection, making this alliance extraordinarily significant.
