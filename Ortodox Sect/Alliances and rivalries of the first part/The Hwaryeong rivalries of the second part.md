# **MARTIAL COUNCIL POLITICAL DIVIDE:**

## **Pro-Law/Pro-Control Faction (The Four Pillars):**
**Belief:** The Eternal War happened because of insufficient oversight and weak enforcement. **Goal:** Strengthen Martial Council authority, increase regulations, centralized monitoring. **Argument:** "Freedom without accountability breeds chaos. We must prevent another Heavenly Demon."

## **Anti-Control/Pro-Freedom Faction (The Iron Brotherhood):**
**Belief:** The Eternal War happened because excessive control created oppression and resentment. **Goal:** Minimize Martial Council interference, protect sect autonomy, individual freedom. **Argument:** "Control without freedom breeds tyranny. Oppression created the Heavenly Demon."

## **Excluded/Observers (Shadow Covenant):**
**Belief:** Both orthodox factions threaten unorthodox existence. **Reality:** Not in Martial Council, but any increase in control threatens them. **Strategy:** Monitor through intelligence, survive through unity, avoid direct confrontation.
