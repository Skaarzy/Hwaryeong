 Divine Thunder Hall a sect created by the pure will and power of Roh Cheon-pa first acting as a defense unit that was placed on the Storm-Carved mountains to protect the kingdom from any upcoming attacks against other factions but later became independent as the kingdom began to ban martial arts in its province, Divine Thunder Hall separated from them and became a powerful sect with their own rules , which specializes in techniques that mimic the destructive and sudden nature of lightning—each strike powerful, explosive, and relentless. The sect’s fighting style is chaotic and sharp, focusing on swift, overwhelming bursts of force, capable of breaking through any defense. The sect still kept the structure of the unit that it once was with some stronger members being awarded the position of a commander who handle the captains which lead and train and organize their own units made of lighting warriors and storm soldiers .each regular soldier occupying an equal position in terms of rank and authority. The only exception to this is the Sect Master, who stands as the sole leader, revered and followed without question. Members are drilled in unity and strength, each one trained to strike as one, with their combat techniques often coordinated like a thunderstorm tearing through the battlefield. And as for the leader positions inheritance its mostly a battle between the commanders and the current sect leader chooses next in line ,nothing other then strategy and strength is looked at for the next in line any connections or amounts of troops a commander has doesn't matter .This sects power and weakness is their territory which they rule with absolute power , but at the same time they don't leave their territory unless its a dire situation thus usualy being late to important news about the outside factions and events .They also don't allow anybody to enter their mountain strongholds  not only because of the danger of their locations but also because they lack knowledge of the outside world they don't trust nobody unless they can prove themselves. Divine Thunder Hall is also the only sect ever to achieve a alliance with The Heavenly Sword sect , which proved to everybody who doubted their power and influence.
