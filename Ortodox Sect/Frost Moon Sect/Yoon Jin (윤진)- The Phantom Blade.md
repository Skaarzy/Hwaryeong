## STORY DESCRIPTION
**Narrative Summary:**
Yoon Jin was once the strongest warrior of the Frost Moon Sect, a living legend whose genius with the sword blended instinct, precision, and qi into seamless art. They called him the "Master of Qi," and when he moved, it was as if the blade itself thought and breathed with him. Unable to wield his blade physically, he turned his focus inward with obsessive discipline, devoting himself entirely to understanding qi itself. From this pursuit came the Frost Moon: Qi-Control Blade Techniques—a revolutionary discipline allowing the sword to be guided purely through qi, without physical touch. Though he could no longer fight as he once did, he perfected the theory and passed it to disciples who carried his teachings across the land.
His qi sensitivity became unparalleled. He could sense the energy of others from miles away, perceive the flow of attacks before they materialized, and predict an opponent's next move as if reading their thoughts directly. While other scholars merely theorized about qi, Yoon Jin sought to push its very boundaries. He trained in brutal conditions—shirtless in deep snow, cultivating his qi as freezing air met the heat radiating from his body. Through relentless discipline, he achieved direct manipulation of qi within his own body, then went further still.
He created a secret art known only to him: Qi Manipulation. This technique allowed him to control the qi of others with his own—a feat requiring such precision that few could even comprehend it. With it, Yoon Jin could halt an opponent's flow of qi entirely or turn their own energy against them. Some whisper he can hold another's qi in his bare hand. Despite appearing vulnerable in his wheelchair, he wields power equal to that of transcendent beings, proving his maxim: "To control the blade, one must first control the mind."

**First Encounter:**
Players might first hear of Yoon Jin through awed whispers among Frost Moon disciples, or see him training in the snow—shirtless, motionless in his wheelchair, qi visibly radiating from his body as frost forms and melts around him in patterns. When approached, he demonstrates his techniques without moving, weapons floating and striking through pure qi control. His presence commands respect not through intimidation but through the undeniable proof that he has transcended physical limitation entirely.

**Jin’s Paralysis:**

Years before the demon war, when Jin was already a master but far from the power he wields now, he roamed Hwaryeong to gain experience and knowledge. After a few days in Dalpo Province—famed for its lawlessness and rampant crime—Jin came upon a horrifying scene.

A family had been attacked. The parents lay in a pool of their own blood, throats cut. Their children were held by figures in black, shadows that seemed almost alive. Behind them stood a massive figure, even taller, staring directly at Jin.

As Jin stepped forward, more shadowy figures leapt from nowhere. Experienced as he was, he dispatched them with skill, but the tall figure moved to the front, signaling the kidnappers to retreat. Jin dashed after them, only to be blocked instantly by the giant shadow—the apparent leader and a formidable warrior.

Jin attacked, confident in his strength, but every strike was stopped as if he were hitting an immovable wall. What struck him most were the leader’s weapons: two sword blades attached to the sides of his hands, handles horizontal, wielded with incredible speed and precision. Jin managed to defend himself, but it wasn’t enough.

Suddenly, the tall shadow disappeared into the ground, reappearing behind Jin and striking his lower back. Whispering into his ear, he said, _“Impressive, yet not enough.”_ Refusing to surrender, Jin reversed his sword into a backhand stance and stabbed the figure in the right side of his abdomen. Both men immediately withdrew their blades and collapsed.

Still conscious, Jin saw another figure approaching—old, slow, and deliberate. Before he could react, he lost consciousness.

It was the immortal **Mu Jin-mok (무진목) – Endless Wood**, laughing softly. _“Both so young and reckless… a shame to let them die.”_ Looking at Jin, he said, _“I cannot fully heal you; he struck your spine. But I can save your life. I hope it’s enough for you to continue growing, even if you cannot walk.”_

Turning to the tall shadow, he added, _“Yeon Ho your luck is extraordinary, connected as you are to the Eternal Tree. I must heal you and take you as my disciple.”_

After healing them, both the immortal and the shadow figure vanished. Jin awoke days later in a hospital, surrounded by his sect’s disciples, who explained his condition. Jin recounted everything that had happened, fully aware of the narrow line between life and death he had just walked.

**Legacy:**
Yoon Jin played a decisive role in the Demon War despite his injury, defending Frost Moon Province and halting the demonic advance through strategy and qi mastery rather than personal combat. His Frost Moon: Qi-Control Blade Techniques spread throughout the martial world, revolutionizing how practitioners understand the relationship between body, mind, and energy. He remains a living legend—proof that the greatest warriors are not those who never fall, but those who transform their falls into new paths forward. His wheelchair has become as iconic as any throne, and his disciples carry forward techniques their master can no longer physically perform himself, each one a testament to spirit triumphing over flesh.
