Baek Chun is the current master of the [[Heavenly Sword Sect]], a man of few words and immense presence. He is not a warrior known for flamboyant techniques or theatrical duels, but for absolute control—of his blade, his thoughts, and his sect.
He wields the **Immortal Blade**, a wide, ancient sword so heavy that few can even lift it made out of Rhenium. Yet in his hands, it moves as if weightless. His style is unhurried and precise; every movement serves a purpose but has a fury to it that is unmatched. He wastes no motion, speaks no unnecessary words, and shows no emotion in battle. Where others flare with energy,Baek Chun is quiet and inevitable—like a storm that does not roar but simply ravages.He is a person who doesnt care about fame nor glory thus him not being known throughout the whole Hwaryeong, yet his power is there to defeat any that challenge him, he is a mayor player in the after demon war era as he is the first to try and unite the sects, going from sect to sect to convince the leaders ,also his despise to the empire is deep but he still thinks that control and power of the leaders is somewhat that must stay and be strong and that not everybody should be able to decide and have opinion on important matters.
His reputation is built on calm judgment and deep discipline and he is respect and known in most provinces as a wise ruler of a big sect. He teaches that the sword is a reflection of the self: if your mind is chaotic, your blade will be crude. His students are trained not only in martial arts but in stillness, patience, and moral clarity. He does not believe in seeking conflict, but he does not shy from it either. When he draws his blade, it is never without cause—and never without result.
Though he is the third in the line of sect masters, many consider him the most complete. He has maintained peace with other sects without bowing, defeated assassins without lifting his arms, and solved internal sect disputes with a single look.His ways made the sect flourish.
In the martial world, his name is rarely spoken lightly. Not because he is feared like a tyrant, but because he is respected like a mountain—quiet, unmoving, and always watching.Just after the demon war he went into seclusion to cultivate and grow stronger and has been in there for about 50 years .
