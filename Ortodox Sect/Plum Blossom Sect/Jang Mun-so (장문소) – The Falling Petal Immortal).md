## STORY DESCRIPTION

**Narrative Summary:**
Jang Mun-so, the Falling Petal Immortal, exists in memory as more myth than man. Those who met him speak of an ancient figure who seemed to belong to another realm entirely—a frail-looking old man with flowing white hair and beard, his layered robes worn and messy, draping off his shoulders like forgotten scrolls left out in the wind. He walked slowly, leaning on a crooked wooden cane that appeared older than memory itself, yet his movements carried a serene, almost divine presence. His face, weathered by uncounted years, held a calm, amused smile—as if he found the entire world gently humorous, as though everything mortal beings worried about was merely children playing at importance.

He had abandoned the sword long ago, claiming "the blade feels heavy when one's heart grows." Instead, he mastered the ultimate expression of the Plum Blossom Arts—techniques that could negate any attack regardless of its power through pure redirection and perfect understanding. His fighting style was purely reactive, like falling petals that never touch the ground. He never attacked first, never got hit, simply existing in a state of perfect defense that made opponents tire themselves out or lose their will to fight entirely. Many claimed he could erase a person's intent to fight rather than defeat them physically, resolving conflicts before they truly began. When he spoke, his voice felt like the last wind before snow falls—gentle, inevitable, carrying wisdom from beyond mortal concerns.

After achieving what others could only call transcendence—a state beyond normal martial arts where he had reportedly met deities and refused their help—he withdrew to the peak of Plum Blossom mountain. There, in a shabby hut beside an ancient plum blossom tree that looked hundreds of years old, he lived in complete simplicity. No food storage, no water supply, no furnace for warmth—only him, the house, and the tree standing in the deep snow. He needed nothing from the world anymore, though he would accept a drink if a visitor brought one, a small concession to human connection. He trained one final disciple, passing on his knowledge to the current Plum Blossom Sword Saint, before retreating into his peaceful seclusion atop the mountain.

His death came at the hands of Hwa-ryeol, the Second Demon Commander, in a battle that burned the entire eastern face of the mountain to ash and char. Despite his transcendent mastery, despite techniques that had made him untouchable for decades, the demon's overwhelming corruption proved too much. His severed head was found impaled on his own crooked cane, planted like a grotesque banner in the scorched earth—a brutal message that even enlightenment has its limits.

**First Encounter:**
Players never meet him alive. They encounter his legend through the awed whispers of Plum Blossom disciples who speak his name with reverence, through the grief-stricken memories of his final student who still mourns the loss, through the horrified accounts of those who discovered his mountain retreat transformed into a hellscape of black stone and dried blood. The Plum Blossom Sect Master's scream of rage, his qi eruption felt by cultivators provinces away, echoes through the story as testament to what was lost.

Later, players might visit that abandoned peak after 1352, finding the scorched battlefield where legend fell. The simple hut is gone, reduced to ash. But somehow, impossibly, the ancient plum blossom tree still stands—singed but alive, a silent testament to peace that even demons could not completely destroy. Players can meditate there, perhaps catching glimpses of understanding that the Falling Petal Immortal once achieved, feeling the weight of what was lost and why his death marks the point where the world could no longer ignore the coming darkness.

**Legacy:**
The Falling Petal Immortal's death becomes the catalyst that forces the martial world to acknowledge the demonic threat. His murder—a master who had achieved transcendence, killed in his own sanctuary—proves that ignoring the signs will lead to catastrophe. The Royal Dynasty can no longer dismiss clan warnings. The sects can no longer pretend the danger is manageable. Even enlightenment, even perfection, fell before the demons.

His teachings survive through his disciple and the Plum Blossom Sect, his philosophy of peaceful resolution and perfect defense continuing to influence generations. His mountain retreat becomes a pilgrimage site where martial artists seek to understand the path he walked, hoping to glimpse the transcendence he achieved. The ancient plum blossom tree, surviving when its master could not, becomes a symbol of resilience—that even when legends fall, their roots remain, and beauty persists even in the harshest winter.

He proved that martial perfection is possible, that one can transcend violence itself and still be a warrior. His final battle, though lost, bought time for investigation and response, making his death both tragedy and sacrifice. The Falling Petal Immortal remains in memory as what martial artists aspire to become, and a grim reminder that aspiration alone cannot guarantee survival against absolute corruption.
