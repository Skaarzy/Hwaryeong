Mun Sang-woo (문련유) - The Jade Spear
Age: 89
Birth year: 1380 (when Mun Tae-min was 58)
alive trough all the game in 1469 he is 89
Mun Sang-woo , the son of Mun Tae-min, stepped into leadership at the age of 16 in year 1396 of the Plum Blossom Sect during his father’s long seclusion that lasted 33 years until 1429 at the age of 49. Like his father, he possesses a pale complexion and a striking contrast of dark hair the difference is his piercing pink eyes—an image both calm and intense. Though not as overwhelmingly powerful as his father, Sang-woo’s strength lies in his keen intelligence, sharp instincts, and deep understanding of the sect’s traditions.
His weapon of choice is a finely crafted spear, known as the **Jade Dragon Spear**, imbued with the sect’s ancient spiritual energy. Sang-woo mastered the **Blossom Spear Technique**, a graceful yet lethal form passed down from the sect’s extensive library—an art that blends swift, flowing strikes with explosive bursts of power, symbolizing the transient beauty and deadly nature of the plum blossom.
While his father was a master of silence and subtlety, Sang-woo’s leadership style is more strategic and perceptive, often relying on careful planning and intuitive judgment to overcome challenges. Though he does not inspire fear through raw power, his disciples respect his wisdom and ability to anticipate enemies’ moves, making him a formidable leader in his own right.He became ruler of sect after his father went into seclusion at first it was a temporary position until his father came out of seclusion but after that happened his father saw his accomplishments and let him stay as a leader with Tae-min at his side to guide him trough it
