## STORY DESCRIPTION

**Narrative Summary:**
Mun Tae-min is the rightful head of the Plum Blossom Sect, the seventh wielder of their sacred sword, and perhaps the greatest master the sect has ever produced. He is a ghost-pale figure with flowing black hair and white eyes that seem blind but see everything. Tall and slim, he moves with such quiet grace that it appears plum blossoms grow beneath his feet. His robes are bleak and murky—he has no interest in fashion or appearance—and his face perpetually carries the look of exhaustion, though none doubt the terrible power beneath that fatigue.

From youth, he demonstrated exceptional talent in both swordsmanship and medicine, techniques not merely precise but unnervingly calm. His instructors said he never fought to win—he fought to calm himself. When he inherited the Plum Blossom Sword, each generation of leaders before him had refined not the physical blade but its spiritual essence through their mastery. Mun Tae-min is said to have achieved the greatest refinement of all, a level of swordsmanship that seems effortless, as if the blade itself moves with intention and his medical needles find acupoints with supernatural ease.

He is cold and reserved, rarely displaying emotion, never scolding or flattering. He leads through example—utter control, flawless technique, and a presence that compels discipline without words. When he moves, the wind quiets. When he speaks, silence falls. When he draws his blade, it is like plum blossoms blooming in winter—beautiful and inevitable death.

During the early Eternal War, he served on the Royal Council, but when his master Jang Mun-so—the Falling Petal Immortal—was killed by the demon Hwa-ryeol, everything changed. Mun Tae-min abandoned his post without explanation, ignored provinces and battles, cared for nothing except finding his master's murderer. Then, before completing his revenge, one of his sect's branches was attacked while he was absent. The guilt drove him into seclusion for years, his son Mun Sang-woo leading the sect in his absence.

When he emerged, he was no longer a master—he was a beast. No one stood near his level of power. His sword techniques had transformed during isolation, perfected through grief and rage. His signature technique, _Falling Petals, Eternal Stillness_, releases petal-like arcs of energy that drift quietly toward targets. But when truly angered, the technique transforms: his sword qi shifts from green to amber pink to burning red, like metal fresh from the forge yet cold as winter. His eyes turn the same color, and it resembles plum blossoms blooming in snow—beautiful, cold, unstoppable.

He found Hwa-ryeol. He killed him. Then he left without word to anyone, his revenge complete. He is not a war hero—he is a necessary force, the embodiment of the sword that strikes only when all else has failed.

**First Encounter:**

Players likely first hear of Mun Tae-min through hushed whispers—the Sword Saint who abandoned the war to hunt his master's killer, who emerged from seclusion as something beyond human. When finally encountered, he is a presence more than a person: ghost-pale, white-eyed, moving in absolute silence. He does not acknowledge those beneath notice. Wind dies around him. His very existence seems to impose stillness on the world. If players witness him draw his blade, they see petal-like energy arcs drifting through the air—death made beautiful, violence transformed into art.

**Legacy:**

Mun Tae-min is the spiritual and martial pillar of the Plum Blossom Sect, though he teaches rarely and selects no disciples publicly. His absence from the Royal Council during the critical early war years weakened the imperial response, but his eventual killing of Hwa-ryeol removed one of the war's greatest threats. He represents the philosophy of restraint—the master who strikes only when everything else has failed, the sword drawn only after all other options are exhausted. His cold demeanor hides depths of loyalty and grief that drove him to abandon duty for vengeance, then return stronger than any had imagined possible. He is admired and feared in equal measure, proof that sometimes the quietest voices command the most absolute authority.
