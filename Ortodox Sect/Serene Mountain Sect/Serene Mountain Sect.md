Serene Mountain Sect or Jeong-san-pa sect 

The Censorate to some of the emperors ,Serene Mountain Sect is a religious sect and also one of the founding sects that was there even before the merger of the martial clans to create the today known Orthodox sects
Myeong-taek The Grand Abbot, is a revered figure from the Serene Mountain Sect, one of the most powerful and secretive sects in the Hwaryeong. The Serene Mountain Sect is famed for its difficult and rigorous training, which combines not only martial techniques but also spiritual discipline. Its disciples are known to endure trials that push both the body and mind to their absolute limits.Yet with all their power they remain mostly neutral and don't interfere in the matters of the marital world , they mostly just worship Buddha and help those who are in need As a young monk, Myeong-taek displayed a deep devotion to the path of enlightenment, spending years meditating in seclusion at the The Serene Temple.The sect itself always had mostly temples spread across the whole land with the Main temple being The Serene Temple which is on the border with The Jade Orchid sect and The Frost moon sect and its the place where most the scriptures and techniques are kept in the famous cave where the stone carved Buddha guards the entrance to the library.That place is also said to be a sacred place where Buddha once lived thus the reasoning of keeping all the scriptures there and building the stone Buddha as well .The sect has big temples in each province that is controlled by the orthodox sects, so in total there are 7 mayor temples along with the eight being The Serene Temple.The reason of why the sect doesn't hold much influence or has more temple is usualy because of Confucian beliefs of the kingdom and the rejection from the Unorthodox sects , and even those that of them have temple they are usualy small and very empty temple with a low amount of monks and almost no worshipers in them.After the demon war and the fall of both the Heavenly Root Sect and The Divine Seal Sect Confucianism became more of a traditional practices and became less popular because of the people trusting the Confucius Taoist less and less as their contribution to the war was more of self protection than protection of all , and the Serene Mountain’s reputation reached beyond the temple walls as they went out of their way to help and give shelter to all no matter who they where and what their condition was , and eventually after the demon war was over the sect was invited to serve as a member of the Censorate an esteemed body that advises the emperor on morality and righteousness.

Sect hierarchy :
Bodhisattva  
The most revered living figure of the sect — not its founder, but the chosen successor to all secret and ultimate techniques. Selected by the Buddha himself for his unmatched kindness, restraint, and mercy, Bodhisattva is the spiritual embodiment of the sect’s highest ideals. Though he rarely intervenes, all acknowledge him as the strongest cultivator alive, surpassing even the Grand Abbot. 

[[Grand Abbot Myeong-taek]]
The highest living authority within the sect, responsible for overseeing all branches and temples. The Grand Abbot interprets sacred texts, guides the sect’s direction, and resolves matters of doctrine or conflict between temples. They are rarely seen and reside in a secluded part of the central monastery.

[[Temple Abbots]]  
The head of an individual temple, responsible for the daily operation, training of disciples, and maintaining harmony within their temple. They answer to the Grand Abbot and ensure their temple follows the sect’s tenets faithfully. Often older and deeply respected, each Temple Abbot may teach unique techniques inherited from their temple’s lineage.

Senior Monks 
A monk who has trained for many years and proven their discipline, skill, and understanding of the sect’s teachings. Senior Monks often mentor younger monks, lead meditation or martial drills, and may be chosen to represent the temple on pilgrimages or councils.

Monks  
The entry-level rank. New initiates who have taken the vows but are still undergoing training and spiritual cultivation. They perform basic duties like cleaning, cooking, copying scriptures, or tending the grounds while learning martial arts, philosophy, and discipline.
