Yang Cheong, the Grand Exorcist, is a mysterious and revered figure cloaked in myth and fear. His presence is unmistakable—he is always surrounded by a floating scroll, long as a serpent, inscribed with glowing, ancient characters that shift and shimmer as if alive. The scroll never touches the ground, whispering softly in a language no common person understands. It is said to contain the names of demons bound and banished by his hand, and its power alone is enough to ward off lesser spirits.
He carries an exorcism staff, worn and marked by countless rituals. Intricate carvings of seals and divine sigils line its length, glowing faintly when evil draws near. The staff is more than a weapon—it is a key, a channel for his binding arts, and a symbol of his authority.

A white cloth is always tied across his eyes, weathered and unwashed, giving the impression of blindness. No one has seen his eyes—not even the emperor. Whether he is truly blind or simply conceals some terrible truth remains one of the Jeong Dynasty’s most whispered mysteries. Some say that to see his eyes is to witness your own fate.

He wears long, loose robes of faded silver and pale gray, trailing behind him like mist. His long white hair falls in tangled waves down his back and over his shoulders, as if untouched by comb or blade. He walks slowly, deliberately, as if the weight of spirits trails his every step.

When Yang Cheong speaks, his voice does not come from his lips. It echoes—a deep, resonant tone that seems to rise from the very air. Only those he chooses to hear it can understand. For others, there is only silence. His words are never wasted and are often layered in double meanings, revealing their true purpose only after events unfold.

He appears rarely, only when the emperor summons him directly or when a great demonic disturbance threatens the land. In his absence, lesser exorcists from his sect carry out their sacred duties. But his shadow looms long—just the whisper of his name is enough to send demons fleeing and silence entire courts.

Even among the highest ranks of the Jeong Dynasty, he is treated not as a man, but as something older and greater—an eternal guardian watching from behind the veil.
