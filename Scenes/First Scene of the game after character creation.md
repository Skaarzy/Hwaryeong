From outside the palace walls, a **distant thrum of drums, stone chimes, and solemn chants** echoing trough the walls 

The **massive red gates** creaked as they began to open, slowly, revealing a **courtyard alive with motion and ritual**. The camera glided past the **glimmering lacquered wood**, carved with dragons and phoenixes, catching the soft morning light, then moved over **crimson and gold banners** swaying in the wind.

Inside, the **king’s coffin** rested on a ceremonial wagon, **black lacquered cypress trimmed with gold**, draped in **crimson silk embroidered with dragons and phoenixes**. **Incense smoke** curled upward, mingling with the mist and morning chill.

The procession continued with **deep, rhythmic chanting**, accompanied by **stone chimes, bronze bells, and ceremonial drums**, echoing across the courtyard. **Pallbearers lifted the coffin**, moving slowly and carefully, while **guards in black lacquered armor with gilded helmets** flanked the wagon, spears raised in precise alignment.

The MC seen forward, bowing low, observing quietly from among the crowd. Every **ribbon snapping, banner fluttering, and glint of gold** carried weight, the magnitude of the moment filling the air. He absorbed the ritual silently, **a witness to the passage of a king and the dawn of a new era**.

As the wagon began its slow journey toward the **southern ceremonial gates**, the drums and chants continued, fading gradually as the camera lingered on the **smoke, banners, and disciplined movements**, before pulling back to show the full scope of the solemn, majestic scene.
