## STORY DESCRIPTION

**Narrative Summary:**
Gang Son-chan was once a promising commoner captivated by legend. At seventeen, he heard the tale of The Wandering Blade and became one of many followers, setting out to find the elusive master. It took him seven long years of searching, during which he trained relentlessly, studying various martial styles and developing his own unique halberd techniques—crafted specifically with the intention of challenging the legend he admired.

When the long-awaited duel finally came, Gang Son-chan landed a strike on the master's neck. Whether it was a fortunate blow or one the Wandering Blade allowed, no one would ever know. Regardless, the Wandering Blade acknowledged him and, in recognition, passed down a hidden martial art—one that merged bloodlust with killing intent. When combined properly, these forces neutralized one another, creating a profound calm in the body that allowed the user to harness bloodlust as a form of qi.

However, as Gang Son-chan studied this technique further, he grew increasingly disturbed by the mounting instability in his master. Overuse of the method—especially without control—took a severe toll on the mind. During the brutal conflict of the Demon War, both Gang and the Wandering Blade led followers in organized resistance. Amid the carnage, the Wandering Blade overused the bloodlust technique on a battlefield already drenched in death, pushing himself past the edge. For the first time, he lost all restraint, slaughtering both allies and enemies indiscriminately. After the war, he withdrew into bloodthirsty isolation.

Witnessing this collapse, Gang Son-chan made a solemn vow: he would not follow his master's doomed path. Drawing on everything he had learned—both from his own training and the techniques he had acquired—he reformed the bloodlust method. In his new approach, all bloodlust was channeled into the weapon, while killing intent was focused into qi. This separation kept the mind clear, making the style far safer and sustainable.

To perfect this reformed technique, he personally forged the Twin Half Moon Jangchang—a unique weapon with two half-moon blades flanking the spear tip. These curved blades force the bloodlust energy to split into three paths, slowing its flow and creating better balance with the killing intent qi. The weapon itself carries symbolic meaning: one half-moon represents his master's destructive path into madness and isolation, while the other represents his own constructive path of building community and lasting strength.

After the Demon War, seeing how the Wandering Blade's philosophy of "abandoning the past" had turned into senseless isolation and carnage, Gang Son-chan founded the Iron Fist Unorthodox Sect. Unlike his master who rejected all bonds and structure, Gang Son-chan believed that those who abandoned their past should create a new family and permanent home together. The sect welcomes outcasts, deserters, and the disillusioned, but instead of endless wandering, they build a stable community where strength serves protection rather than conquest.

**First Encounter:**

Players might encounter Gang Son-chan as the stern yet protective leader of a thriving community of reformed warriors. Tall and powerfully built, wearing practical red and dark robes with iron bracers on his forearms, he cuts an imposing figure. His calloused hands show years of weapon training, and the unique Twin Half Moon Jangchang at his side immediately marks him as someone extraordinary. When he speaks, his voice carries pragmatic authority—no wasted words, no philosophical posturing, just the direct commands of someone who has seen what happens when power corrupts. He tests those who approach not with impossible challenges but with simple questions: "What are you running from? And what will you build instead?" Those who seek only power are turned away. Those who seek purpose and family are welcomed home.

**Legacy:**
Gang Son-chan stands as proof that students need not repeat their masters' mistakes. His reformation of the dangerous bloodlust technique into a sustainable martial art saved countless disciples from the madness that consumed the Wandering Blade. His founding of the Iron Fist Sect created something unprecedented—a stable unorthodox sect that builds rather than destroys, that accepts outcasts and gives them lasting purpose. His achievement of immortality in 1392 ensures that his vision will continue far beyond a normal lifetime. While his master is remembered as a cautionary tale of power corrupting through isolation, Gang Son-chan's legacy grows as an example of how witnessing failure can inspire a better path—how strength can be used to forge not just oneself but an entire community built to last.

# Twin Half Moon Jangchang
## Origin & Creation
The **Twin Half Moon Jangchang** is a unique weapon created by Gang Son-chan himself after he developed his reformed version of his master's bloodlust technique. Originally starting with a traditional jangchang, Gang Son-chan discovered a critical flaw when channeling his new martial arts through the weapon.

## Technical Innovation
The weapon began as a standard jangchang, but Gang Son-chan found that the energy flow of bloodlust moved too quickly through the straight-line spear design, making it difficult to control and balance with his killing intent qi. To solve this problem, he personally forged and added **two half-moon blades** on each side of the spear tip.
These curved blades serve a practical purpose: they force the bloodlust energy to split into 3 paths making the energy travel in a slower, more controlled paths around the weapon's head, creating better balance and allowing for more precise energy distribution between bloodlust and killing intent.

## Symbolic Meaning
The choice of **twin half-moons** carries deep personal significance for Gang Son-chan:

- **One half-moon** represents his master's destructive path - the Wandering Blade's descent into madness and isolation
- **The other half-moon** represents his own constructive path - building community and lasting strength

The dual blades serve as a constant reminder of the difference between his master's philosophy and his own, ensuring he never forgets what happened to his master and never strays from his chosen path of creating rather than destroying.
When wielded, the Twin Half Moon Jangchang channels bloodlust through the curved blades while focusing killing intent through the central spear point, creating the perfect balance that makes Gang Son-chan's reformed technique both powerful and sustainable - unlike his master's uncontrollable and self-destructive method.
