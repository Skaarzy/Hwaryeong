Built in a mountainous region with natural defenses, the sect’s headquarters looks like a fortified village. At its center is a communal forge where members make their own weapons—part of the sect’s ethic of creating rather than taking. The sect was founded after the Demon War by a former disciple of the Wandering Blade who had parted ways with his master. Their techniques echo the Wandering Blade’s but are refined into a controlled form of bloodlust that doesn’t consume the user.
The Iron Fist took root on the island left desolate after the Demon War—the old Divine Seal sect’s land had been burned and abandoned for twenty years, so no one cared that a new group settled there. They rebuilt: houses, training grounds, infrastructure, then began recruiting warriors and doing mercenary work—bounties, spying, sabotage—and their methods were loud and brutal.
The island became the sect’s main base: leadership, training, weapons caches, secure communications, ship repair, and final planning. After years of scraping by in half‑ruined villages, royal officials convinced the sect to take part in unrest; when those officials died, Dong Tak seized the plan. He promised Gong and his followers places inside the main Royal City and a seat on the Royal Council .On the mainland, scattered safe houses and front businesses handled recruitment, funds, shelter, message relay, and cover operations. Movement hid in normal merchant and fishing traffic, supplemented by occasional small night landings. A few bribed harbormasters and customs clerks smoothed paperwork; risky runs used smugglers or third‑party crews so the sect itself rarely sailed openly.
Communications ran on coded messages hidden in mundane cargo, religious items, or ledgers, moved by couriers posing as merchants, pilgrims, or monks, using dead‑drops and rotation. Mainland cells were compartmentalized; the island command spoke only to key lieutenants. The island stockpiled food, weapons, and coin; safe houses were resupplied in small batches. The sect also funded itself through legal fronts—trading firms and tax‑exempt temple donations. Recruitment moved slowly and carefully via planted agents in guilds, taverns, temples, and among migrant workers, while propaganda spread through sermons, charity, and merchant gossip to avoid traceability.
They mitigated risks—blockade, seized shipments, exposed safe houses, obvious patterns—by using redundant supply chains, backup locations, fake identities, irregular schedules, multiple routes, and seasonal pauses.
