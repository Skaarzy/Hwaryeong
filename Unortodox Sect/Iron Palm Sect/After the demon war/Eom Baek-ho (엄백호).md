Yan Baihu was a general of a famous battalion under the rule of Jeong emperor in the demon war.This battalion was under special orders to go around the country and defend villages and small cities from the demonic forces and people influenced by demons.They were powerful and strategically smart, baihu as a young general was merciless and calculating many of his men respected him because he always put himself at the front line with other soldiers.When he was young he didn't have much control over himself and was known to get drunk and angry because of what he witnessed on the battlefield. But after many battles and many scars he earned himself the title of Grand General which gives him control over more than one battalion , and a estate in the main capital of the Jeong Dynasty [[1. Cheon-sim (천심) - Heaven's Heart]] .After all that baihu still felt incomplete and empty when he came back from battlefields.A Couple of years after the war ended he retired and gave back all of his honorary things like the estate and title away and, went to search for something to fill that emptiness.He roamed the Jeong Dynasty for years and then deep in a the abandoned territory once ruled by the iron palm sect which was destroyed by the demon worshipers and now is just a wild place where only the ones born there are continuing to live in that mountain and on a random day while searching for a place to sleep over he stumbled on the great white tiger the protector of the mountain .He and the tiger fought and chased each other around the mountain for two weeks until baihu won.Nobody know how he won or even why he continued to fight.After he won he stayed at that mountain and is said that he achieved enlightenment there.For years on after that he protected that whole mountain and made it his own ,not as a ruler but a guardian .Everybody knew when they came to that mountain they should be wary of baihu but nobody knew why he was protecting the mountain.The name of the mountain is [[Baek Ho-san (백호산) - White Tiger Mountain]].When he was a young general he used a Guandao as his weapon then later after he defeated the white tiger he started using his hands and dual Kamas which he just found in a village which were made for farming but where deadly when used in battle.After he became immortal he began to use martial arts and made his own techniques which none other know and are unique and considered almost god like . After the white tiger died and baihu became the mountains protector things changed for the better but the original rules still applied, which were that he supplied the villages with meat and the villagers aren't allowed to hunt only farm also its forbidden to kill or give judgment without his permission, just now it was baihu that was upholding them the only difference is that he built himself a house and everybody knew where he was staying so they could ask for help or advice.He himself was known to visit the villages regularly even if it wasn't delivering meat or helping villagers.
