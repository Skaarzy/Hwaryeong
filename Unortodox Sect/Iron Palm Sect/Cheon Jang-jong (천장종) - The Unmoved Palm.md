## STORY DESCRIPTION

**Narrative Summary:**
Cheon Jang-jong, known as The Iron Hand or The Unmoved Palm, is perhaps the most deceptive warrior in the entire martial world. His presence alone can silence a battlefield, yet most who first meet him see only a jolly, talkative fat man who seems harmless—even foolish. He is extroverted and friendly, eating constantly without ever feeling full, making people think he's just another dumb brute who enjoys food and good company.

This is exactly what he wants them to think.

Cheon Jang-jong is said to have once crushed a mountain in half with a single upward strike and halted a charging war elephant using nothing but his palm. But these displays of raw power are not what define him—restraint does. He teaches that true mastery lies not in using power, but in knowing when not to. He once stood in a duel for three hours without throwing a single strike, simply waiting until his opponent surrendered from exhaustion and fear, proving that the greatest weapon is often patience itself.

Though he never wields a weapon, he is considered one of the most dangerous warriors alive. His ability to eat as much as he wants and never be full isn't gluttony—it's strategic energy storage. He consumes food, protein, and fat constantly, storing it all within his body. Then, when battle comes, everything changes. His easy-going, chatty demeanor vanishes completely, replaced by stern, commanding silence. His body undergoes a dramatic transformation as he releases all that stored energy, his fat converting into massive, bulky muscle in moments. His ultimate technique, Iron Forged Body, goes even further—digesting and consuming all stored energy into pure power until his body becomes harder than diamond itself.

In this transformed state, rumors claim that even blades shatter upon contact with his skin. Those foolish enough to test him find themselves broken before he even raises his hand, defeated by psychological warfare and the sheer impossibility of what they're witnessing. His combat commands are rarely repeated—students learn quickly that under his watchful eye, you listen the first time or suffer the consequences.

**First Encounter:**

Players will likely first meet Cheon Jang-jong as a friendly, talkative fat man who seems more interested in his next meal than martial arts. He'll joke, laugh, and appear completely harmless—perhaps even offering to share food. Most will underestimate him completely. Then combat erupts, and everything changes. The jolly exterior vanishes like smoke. His body ripples and transforms, fat converting to massive muscle in seconds. His eyes grow fierce. His voice drops to stern commands that are never repeated. And when he moves, the ground shakes. Players who attacked thinking he was weak suddenly find themselves facing one of the most terrifying opponents imaginable—and realizing too late that they've been psychologically manipulated from the moment they met him.

**Legacy:**
Cheon Jang-jong stands as the ultimate proof that appearances can be completely deceiving and that the strongest warriors often appear the most harmless. His Iron Palm Sect teaches disciples that complete mastery over your own body is the foundation of all true power—that weapons are crutches for those who haven't achieved perfect physical control. His legendary feats (the crushed mountain, the stopped elephant) prove his philosophy correct, while his deceptive jolly demeanor ensures he's always underestimated until far too late. Students who train under him have their weaknesses burned away like fat in fire, emerging as warriors who understand that true strength comes from within and that restraint, not display, marks the greatest masters. He remains a living paradox: the friendly fat man who is secretly one of the deadliest forces in the martial world, proving with every transformation that those who judge by appearance have already lost the fight.
