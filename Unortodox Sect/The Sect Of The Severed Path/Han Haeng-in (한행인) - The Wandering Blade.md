## STORY DESCRIPTION

**Narrative Summary:**
Han Haeng-in, The Wandering Blade, began as a warrior seeking to prove he was not weak after his sect attempted to banish him for that very reason. His response was absolute: he killed them all, even the sect elders, taking his former sect leader's sword as a trophy. This weapon—a medieval long sword with a long hilt that he wields with only one hand—became his symbol as he wandered, searching for his ultimate opponent and accepting only those who could cut him in one move as potential disciples. No one ever succeeded.

He became an expert in all weapons, able to master any blade, spear, or staff instantly, yet carried only that single sword. His self-made techniques were based on fire and heat, but his true collection came from every master he defeated and killed, stealing their martial arts and adding them to his arsenal. He built a following not through teaching but through example—rogue warriors who had abandoned their sects found in him a respected leader, building camps and houses in his name. He welcomed the poor and starving, acting generous and helpful when not fighting.

But in combat, he transformed completely into a lunatic willing to put his life on the line for victory even in simple duels. The amount of killing intent he emitted was greater than thousands of soldiers, overwhelming opponents before swords even clashed. Those who survived duels with him spoke of a madman who cared nothing for his own survival if it meant defeating his enemy.

During the Demon War, he led his followers in organized resistance, learning and mastering a hidden martial art that merged bloodlust with killing intent. When properly balanced, these forces neutralized each other, creating profound calm that allowed bloodlust to be harnessed as qi. But on a battlefield already drenched in blood, he overused the technique, pushing past all limits. For the first time, he lost complete restraint, slaughtering both allies and enemies indiscriminately. After the war ended, he withdrew into bloodthirsty isolation of his own volition.

From his forties onward, he became progressively more insane, consumed by bloodlust and killing intent. His followers, who had believed in him and followed him, slowly abandoned him as he descended into something no longer human. In his final twenty years, he simply sat in the main hall of an abandoned mansion—motionless, neither eating, sleeping, drinking, nor breathing. Those who entered the hall died from the killing intent alone. Those who survived this pressure, he saw as challengers and killed personally.

In front of that abandoned mansion, worshippers now pray to him and force people to enter as sacrifices in his name. Some say he died and an evil spirit possesses his corpse. Others claim he achieved immortality through his techniques and went insane after seeing what awaited on the other side. The truth is unknown, but what is certain is this: The Wandering Blade who once helped the poor and sought worthy combat has become a horror that sits in darkness, killing all who approach.

**First Encounter:**

Players encountering The Wandering Blade will have vastly different experiences depending on when in his life they meet him. In his younger years, they might find a calm, philosophical warrior willing to help travelers and discuss the nature of strength—until someone challenges him, and they witness the transformation into a combat-obsessed lunatic who fights with suicidal intensity. In his middle years, he becomes increasingly dangerous and unpredictable, the calm periods shorter and the bloodlust more evident. His camps of followers still exist, offering shelter to outcasts, though he rarely visits anymore.

In his final years, players will only hear legends—stories of the abandoned mansion where something sits in darkness, where the very air kills those who enter. If they're foolish enough to approach, they'll feel the killing intent from outside the building, a pressure so intense it makes breathing difficult. Those who enter the main hall see a figure sitting motionless in the center—whether man, corpse, or something else is impossible to tell. And then, one way or another, they die.

**Legacy:**
The Wandering Blade's legacy is split between inspiration and warning. His philosophy of "carving your own path" and accepting those who abandoned their past inspired countless outcasts to find new purpose. His camps and followers created communities for the disillusioned and poor. Gang Son-chan, his acknowledged follower, learned from him and reformed his dangerous techniques into something sustainable, proving the master's teachings had value despite his fate.

But he also serves as the ultimate cautionary tale about bloodlust's cost. His descent from generous warrior to isolated horror shows what happens when power and obsession consume humanity entirely. His mastery of the bloodlust technique—the dangerous version that Gang Son-chan later reformed—proved too powerful for even his strong will to control indefinitely. In the end, The Wandering Blade carved his own path so completely that it led him away from everything human, leaving behind only a legend of what sits in darkness, neither alive nor dead, waiting for challengers who will never be worthy enough to free him from what he has become.
